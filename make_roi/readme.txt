1. compare_atlases: exploratory analysis to compare and contrast different atlases
2. make_atlas_roi_for_rsa: make ROI from functional atlase
3. make_roi_from_functional_activation_thresholdedMGS: make ROI from overlapping thresholded MGS t stats images with functional atlases (p < 0.05, cluster size > 50)
4. make_roi_from_functional_activation_thresholdedMGS_left_right: same as 3, but for left and right hemispheres respectively
5. make_roi_from_functional_activation_topN: make ROI from selecting top N activated voxels within functional atlases
6. make_roi_from_functional_activation_topN_left_right: same as 5, but for left and right hemispheres respectively
7. make_roi_figures_for_paper: make ROI figures for paper
